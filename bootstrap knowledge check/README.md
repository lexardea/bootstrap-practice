This is a registration form for yoga workshops.

<!-- <head> -->
I linked to the external bootstrap stylesheet.

<!-- <body> -->
The navigation menu is static and spans across the top of the page. It toggles to a hamburger menu on small screens.
Navigation menu items link to home page, upcoming workshops, and this registration form as this is the upcoming workshop.
Navigation links are currently dead.

The images section includes a banner image that spans the page and a circle image underneath the banner.

The title of the workshop is underneath the circle image.

The registration form asks for name, email, password, and includes a checkbox asking to agree to terms and conditions. It includes a submit button styled with the bootstrap primary color, green.

A table lists upcoming workshops and spots available. 

All elements on the page are responsive using bootstrap containers.
